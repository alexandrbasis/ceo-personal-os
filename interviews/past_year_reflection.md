# Past Year Reflection Interview

A guided self-conversation for reviewing the past 12 months.

---

## Before You Begin

Find a quiet hour. No phone. No interruptions. This isn't a form to rush through — it's a conversation with yourself about what just happened in your life.

Answer in whatever length feels right. Some questions might get a sentence. Others might get a page. Follow what wants to be said.

## Opening

Take three slow breaths. Let go of what's next on your calendar. For the next hour, there's nowhere else to be.
