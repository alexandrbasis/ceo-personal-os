# Identity and Values Interview

A guided self-conversation for understanding who you are beneath the roles you play.

## Before You Begin

This interview goes deeper than goals and performance. It asks about identity — who you are when the titles are stripped away.

There's no urgent action required after this. It's exploration. Some of it might be uncomfortable. That's usually where the insight lives.

## After This Interview

This isn't a one-time exercise. Your identity evolves. Return to these questions annually or during major life transitions.

Note key insights in `memory.md`. Not to-do items — insights about who you are that you want to remember.

Identity work isn't navel-gazing. Knowing yourself is a strategic advantage. Leaders who understand their own drives, fears, and patterns make better decisions.

*You are more than your resume. You are more than your company. This interview helps you remember that.*
