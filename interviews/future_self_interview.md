# Future Self Interview

A guided conversation with the version of you who lives ten years from now.

---

## The Concept

This interview uses a visualization technique: you're going to receive advice from yourself at age [CURRENT AGE + 10]. This future version of you has already lived through what you're about to face. They know which decisions mattered and which fears were overblown. They know what you should have prioritized.

This isn't mystical. It's a thinking tool. Your subconscious often knows more than your conscious mind admits. This exercise gives it voice.

## Before You Begin

1. Calculate your age ten years from now: ___
2. Find a quiet space where you won't be interrupted
3. Close your eyes and spend two minutes imagining that future version of you — where they live, what they look like, what they've accomplished, what wisdom they carry
4. When you can see them clearly, begin

## Setting the Scene

**Imagine:** You're sitting across from yourself, ten years older. They look at you with warmth and understanding. They remember exactly where you are now. They know what's about to happen — the wins, the losses, the surprises, the growth.

They're here to help. They want you to avoid their regrets and capitalize on their insights.

## After This Interview

This might feel strange. That's okay. The exercise works by accessing intuition that's usually drowned out by daily noise.

Some of what emerged may be wishful thinking. Some may be genuine insight. Over time, you'll learn to tell the difference.

Add key insights to `memory.md`. Return to this interview during times of uncertainty — your future self is always available for consultation.

*"Your future self is watching you right now through memories." — Unknown*

*Note: This exercise is adapted from various therapeutic and coaching traditions that use future self visualization as a decision-making and insight tool.*
