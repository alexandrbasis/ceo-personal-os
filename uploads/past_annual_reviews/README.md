# Past Annual Reviews

Place any previous annual reviews, year-end reflections, or structured self-assessments here.

## What to Upload

- Previous annual review documents (any format)
- End-of-year reflections from journals
- Goal-setting documents from past years
- Any structured self-assessment you've completed

## How to Use These

1. Read through them looking for patterns
2. Note recurring goals (things you keep wanting but not achieving)
3. Note recurring struggles (themes that keep appearing)
4. Note strengths (what keeps working)
5. Note blind spots (warnings you've received but not heeded)
6. Summarize key insights in `memory.md`

## File Naming Convention

Suggested: `[YEAR]_annual_review.md` or `[YEAR]_reflection.md`

Example:
- `2023_annual_review.md`
- `2022_year_end_reflection.pdf`
- `2021_goals_and_review.docx`

*The more history you include, the better the pattern recognition. Even rough notes from past years are valuable.*
