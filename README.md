# CEO Personal Operating System

A private, single-user system for reflection, goal-setting, and maintaining clarity. Built for founders, CEOs, and operators who want insight without overwhelm.

This is not software. It's a thinking system — a set of prompts, frameworks, and templates that help you understand where you've been, decide where you're going, and stay aligned along the way.

---

## How This Works

Everything here is plain text. You edit files directly. There's no app, no dashboard, no login. Just you, your thoughts, and a calm structure to hold them.

**The system serves four rhythms:**
- **Daily** — 5 minutes of grounding
- **Weekly** — 20 minutes of honest assessment
- **Quarterly** — 2 hours of strategic review
- **Annually** — A full day of deep reflection and planning

## Quick Start (Under 15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Personalize Your Foundation (10 minutes)

1. Open `north_star.md` and write one sentence about what matters most to you right now
2. Open `principles.md` and review the starter principles — edit, delete, or add your own
3. Skim `frameworks/life_map.md` to understand the six domains you'll be tracking

### Step 2: Set Up Your First Check-In (5 minutes)

1. Create your first daily check-in:
   - Copy `reviews/daily/TEMPLATE.md`
   - Rename it to today's date (e.g., `2025-01-01.md`)
   - Fill it out

That's it. You're running the system.

---

## Daily Practice (5 minutes)

**When:** Morning or end of day — pick one and be consistent

**What:** Create a new file in `reviews/daily/` using the template

**The daily check-in asks five questions:**
1. Energy level (1-10)
2. One meaningful win
3. One friction point
4. One thing to let go of
5. One priority for tomorrow

This isn't journaling. It's a five-minute calibration. Get in, answer honestly, get out.

---

## Weekly Review (20 minutes)

**When:** Friday afternoon or Sunday evening

**What:** Create a new file in `reviews/weekly/` using the template

**The weekly review covers:**
- What actually moved the needle this week
- What was noise disguised as work
- Where your time leaked
- One strategic insight
- One adjustment for next week

Be honest about what didn't matter. Most "busy" isn't productive.

---

## Quarterly Review (2 hours)

**When:** Last week of March, June, September, December

**What:** Create a new file in `reviews/quarterly/` using the template

**The quarterly review examines:**
- Progress against your 1-year goals
- Alignment between daily actions and stated priorities
- Energy-to-output ratio (where are you spending energy with poor returns?)
- Course corrections needed

This is where you catch drift before it becomes regret.

---

## Annual Review (Full Day)

**When:** December or early January — block an entire day

**What:** Work through the annual review template in `reviews/annual/`

**The annual review process:**

1. **Morning: Reflection** (3 hours)
   - Complete the Past Year Reflection interview (`interviews/past_year_reflection.md`)
   - Review all quarterly reviews from the past year
   - Update your Life Map (`frameworks/life_map.md`)

2. **Midday: Pattern Recognition** (2 hours)
   - Review any past documents in `uploads/`
   - Look for repeated goals, recurring failures, consistent blind spots
   - Update `memory.md` with key insights

3. **Afternoon: Future Design** (3 hours)
   - Work through the Vivid Vision framework
   - Update Ideal Lifestyle Costing
   - Set 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year goals
   - Refine your North Star and Principles

This day is an investment. Protect it completely.

## The Frameworks

This system incorporates thinking tools from several sources, adapted for CEO use:

| Framework | Source | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Annual Review | Dr. Anthony Gustin | Structured year-end reflection |
| Vivid Vision | Tony Robbins tradition | Detailed future-state visualization |
| Ideal Lifestyle Costing | Tim Ferriss | Understanding what your life actually costs |
| Life Map | Alex Lieberman | Balancing six key life domains |

Each framework has its own file in `frameworks/` with full explanations and prompts.

Additional mental models included:
- Energy Management (not just time management)
- Personal Board of Directors
- Regret Minimization Framework
- Leverage vs. Effort Analysis

---

## The Interview System

In `interviews/` you'll find guided self-conversations:

- **Past Year Reflection** — What happened, what it meant, what you learned
- **Identity and Values** — Who you are beneath the role
- **Future Self Interview** — Advice from ten-years-ahead you

These aren't therapy. They're structured thinking. The questions are designed to surface what you already know but haven't articulated.

---

## Uploading Past Documents

If you have previous annual reviews, performance reviews, journal entries, or notes:

1. Place them in `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
2. Read through them looking for:
   - Goals that repeat year after year (unfinished business)
   - Failures that keep happening (systemic issues)
   - Strengths you undervalue
   - Blind spots you've been warned about
3. Summarize key patterns in `memory.md`

The system learns from your history. The more you feed it, the better it serves you.

---

## The Memory File

`memory.md` is your institutional knowledge about yourself. It holds:

- Patterns you've noticed across years
- Insights that keep proving true
- Warnings to your future self
- Commitments you've made

Review this file before every quarterly and annual review.

## Design Principles

This system was built with specific beliefs:

1. **Clarity over complexity** — If it doesn't fit in a text file, it's too complicated
2. **Honesty over comfort** — The prompts ask real questions, not flattering ones
3. **Reflection over reaction** — Slowing down is the point
4. **Privacy over sharing** — This is for you alone
5. **Direction over goals** — Knowing where you're headed matters more than hitting metrics

---

## Assumptions Made

This system assumes:

- You are a CEO, founder, or senior operator
- You have meaningful autonomy over your time and decisions
- You value depth over breadth in self-reflection
- You can protect time for this practice
- You prefer plain text over apps
- You want insight, not motivation

If these don't fit, adapt the system. It's yours now.

---

## How to Maintain This

**Daily:** One file, five questions, five minutes

**Weekly:** One file, honest assessment, twenty minutes

**Quarterly:** One file, strategic review, two hours

**Annually:** One day, full process, complete renewal

The system only works if you use it. Start with daily. Build the habit. The rest follows.

---

## One More Thing

This is a mirror, not a judge. The goal isn't to achieve some perfect state of productivity. It's to know yourself well enough to make good decisions, catch problems early, and spend your finite time on what actually matters to you.

Be honest with yourself here. No one else will see this.

Begin.
