# North Star

Your North Star is not a goal. It's a direction. Goals can be achieved and checked off. A North Star is the orientation that makes all your goals make sense.

This document holds one thing: **what matters most to you right now, in this season of your life.**

## The Test

When you're unsure about a decision, ask:

**"Does this move me toward my North Star, away from it, or is it neutral?"**

- Toward: Default yes
- Away: Default no
- Neutral: Consider opportunity cost

Not everything has to connect to your North Star. But the things that take significant time or energy should.

## Examples of North Star Statements

*For reference — delete this section once you've written your own:*

- "Build something that outlasts me while being present for the years my children will remember."
- "Create financial freedom that enables complete choice about how I spend my time."
- "Master my craft to the point where the work itself becomes the reward."
- "Repair my health so I can show up fully for the next chapter."
- "Build a company that solves [PROBLEM] for millions of people."
- "Transition from operator to investor/advisor on my own terms."
- "Find work that doesn't feel like a compromise between meaning and money."

Your North Star doesn't need to be profound. It needs to be true.
