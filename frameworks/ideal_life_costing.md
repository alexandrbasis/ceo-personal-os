# Ideal Lifestyle Costing

*Adapted from Tim Ferriss's Lifestyle Design principles*

Most people never calculate what their ideal life actually costs. They either assume it's impossibly expensive or they're working toward a number they never examined. This exercise gives you a real number — and often it's different than you think.

---

## The Purpose

This framework helps you answer: **"What does the life I actually want cost?"**

Not the life you think you should want. Not the life that impresses others. The life that would make you deeply satisfied day-to-day.

Once you know this number, you can:
- Stop working toward goals that don't matter
- Recognize when you have "enough"
- Make trade-offs with clarity
- Reduce anxiety about money by knowing your target

| Variable expenses | $ |
| Ideal additions | $ |
| Annual extras (monthly) | $ |
| **TOTAL MONTHLY** | **$** |

**Annual Total:**

TOTAL MONTHLY × 12 = **$____________ per year**

**Add 20% buffer for taxes/unexpected:**

## Interpretation

### If the number is lower than expected:

Many people discover their ideal life costs less than they assumed. This often means:
- You're working toward a number that doesn't matter
- You could achieve your target faster
- You have more freedom than you realized
- Your goals might be inherited from others, not chosen

### If the number is higher than expected:

This isn't a problem — it's clarity. Now you know:
- What you're actually working toward
- What trade-offs might reduce the number
- Where you might be overspending on non-essentials
- What earning capacity you need to build

### If you're already at the number:

Congratulations. You've won a game most people never define. Now:
- Consider what you're trading for money you don't need
- Think about working less or differently
- Explore what you'd do if money weren't the driver
- Protect this position

## Trade-Off Analysis

*Look at your ideal additions and ask: What would you trade?*

| Desired Addition | Cost | Would trade: | Would NOT trade: |
|------------------|------|--------------|------------------|
| | $ | | |
| | $ | | |
| | $ | | |

**What could you eliminate from your ideal that doesn't actually matter to you?**

-
-

**What's non-negotiable no matter the cost?**

## Leverage Questions

1. **What would cut this number in half without reducing happiness?**
   *Location change? Lifestyle change? Different housing?*

2. **What are you paying for that you don't actually use or enjoy?**

3. **Where are you spending to impress others rather than satisfy yourself?**

4. **What free or cheap things would actually make your life better?**

---

## The Real Question

This framework isn't about minimizing expenses or maximizing income. It's about clarity.

**The question isn't "How do I afford my ideal life?"**

**The question is "What is my ideal life, and how much does it actually cost?"**

Often, the life you actually want is different from the life you've been conditioned to want. This exercise helps you see the difference.

---

## Update Annually

Your ideal life evolves. What you wanted at 30 differs from 40, which differs from 50. Redo this exercise each year during your annual review.
