# Life Map

*Adapted from Alex Lieberman's Life Map framework*

Life isn't just work. Most CEOs know this intellectually but live as if work is the only domain that matters. This framework ensures you're building a complete life, not just a successful career.

## The Six Domains

Alex Lieberman's Life Map divides life into six interconnected domains:

1. **Career** — Work, business, professional growth
2. **Relationships** — Partner, family, friendships, community
3. **Health** — Physical, mental, energy, longevity
4. **Meaning** — Purpose, spirituality, contribution, legacy
5. **Finances** — Money, security, freedom, wealth
6. **Fun** — Play, hobbies, adventure, enjoyment

Each domain matters. None can fully compensate for another. A complete life requires attention to all six.

4. Write a one-paragraph reflection on your life balance this year
5. Set one theme for life balance next year

## A Note on Balance

Perfect balance isn't the goal. Life has seasons. Sometimes work demands everything. Sometimes family needs more. Sometimes health becomes the priority.

The goal isn't equal time in all domains. It's conscious choice about allocation, honest assessment of costs, and regular recalibration.

You can't have everything at once. But over time, you can have a complete life if you pay attention to all the pieces.
