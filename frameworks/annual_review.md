# Annual Review Framework

*Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review methodology*

This framework provides structure for a deep end-of-year reflection. Unlike quick check-ins, the annual review is designed to take real time — ideally a full day or at minimum several hours across a few days.

The purpose isn't productivity. It's understanding. Understanding what happened, what it meant, and what you want next.

---

## How This Works

The Annual Review has three phases:

1. **Look Back** — Understand what actually happened this year
2. **Look Inward** — Assess who you've become and what you've learned
3. **Look Forward** — Clarify what you want and set intentions

Work through each section in order. Write your answers directly in this document or in a separate file in `reviews/annual/`.

## Phase 1: Look Back

**What did you start but not complete?**

## A Note on Honesty

This review only works if you're honest. No one is grading you. No one will see this unless you share it. The purpose is clarity, and clarity requires truth.

If you find yourself writing what you think you should feel rather than what you actually feel, stop. Take a break. Come back and try again.

The goal isn't to feel good about your answers. It's to see clearly.
