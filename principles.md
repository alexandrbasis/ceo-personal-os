# Operating Principles

These are the principles that guide your decisions when the path isn't clear. They're not aspirations — they're commitments about how you operate.

Review these quarterly. Update them when they no longer feel true.

## Starter Principles

Below are common principles that resonate with many leaders. **Delete what doesn't fit. Edit what's close. Add what's missing.**

### Decision-Making

**"When in doubt, choose the path that builds optionality."**
Avoid decisions that close doors permanently unless the upside is overwhelming.

**"Speed matters more than perfection in 80% of decisions."**
Identify the 20% where precision matters. Move fast on the rest.

**"What would I do if I weren't afraid?"**
Use this question when you notice yourself avoiding something important.

### Energy & Attention

**"Protect the morning."**
Your best thinking happens before the world starts demanding responses.

**"Say no to good opportunities so you can say yes to great ones."**
Every yes is a no to something else. Be deliberate.

**"Energy management matters more than time management."**
An hour rested is worth three hours depleted.

### People & Relationships

**"Hire slow, fire fast, but always with dignity."**
Misalignment doesn't improve with time. Part ways cleanly.

**"Assume good intent until proven otherwise."**
Most friction comes from miscommunication, not malice.

**"The people who challenge you are more valuable than those who agree."**
Seek disagreement from people you respect.

### Work & Output

**"Done is better than perfect, but shipped is better than done."**
Finishing work that no one sees is just expensive practice.

**"Focus on leverage, not effort."**
The question isn't "how hard am I working?" but "what's the multiplier on this work?"

**"If it won't matter in five years, don't spend more than five minutes upset about it."**
Save emotional energy for what actually matters.

### Personal

**"Health is the foundation. Everything else depends on it."**
Sleep, movement, and nutrition are non-negotiable infrastructure.

**"Presence over productivity with the people who matter."**
Your family doesn't need you efficient. They need you there.

**"Regret minimization beats optimization."**
When you're old, you won't regret what you tried. You'll regret what you avoided.

## How to Use This Document

1. **Before major decisions:** Scan your principles. Does the choice align?
2. **When stuck:** Ask which principle applies to this situation
3. **Quarterly:** Review and update. You change. These should too.
4. **Annually:** Deep review. Are these still true? What's missing?

Principles aren't constraints. They're clarity. They let you decide faster because you've already done the values work.
