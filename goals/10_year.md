## The Purpose of Ten-Year Thinking

Ten years is far enough away that almost anything is possible. In ten years, you can:

- Build a billion-dollar company from scratch
- Completely master a new field
- Raise children from infancy to pre-teen
- Transform your health at the cellular level
- Build generational wealth
- Relocate anywhere and build a new life
- Write books, build movements, change industries

Ten-year thinking isn't about precise prediction. It's about direction. It's asking: "If things go well, where could I be?"
