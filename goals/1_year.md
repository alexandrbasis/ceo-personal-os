## The Purpose of One-Year Goals

One-year goals are the bridge between your vision and your daily actions. They're specific enough to measure, near enough to feel real, but ambitious enough to require real change.

These goals should connect to your North Star. If a goal doesn't serve your larger direction, question why it's here.

## Goal-Setting Principles

1. **Fewer is better.** 5-7 goals maximum. More than that dilutes focus.
2. **Be specific.** Vague goals can't fail — and they can't succeed either.
3. **Include success criteria.** How will you know you achieved it?
4. **Balance domains.** Don't let one area of life consume all your goals.
5. **Make them yours.** These are for you, not for impressing anyone.
